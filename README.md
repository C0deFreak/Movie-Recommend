# Movie Recommend
 Welcome to my movie recommendation website, built using a combination of Python, JavaScript, Django, and React!

My goal with this project was to create a user-friendly platform that allows users to discover new movies based on their preferences and interests. The website uses a recommendation algorithm to suggest movies based on various factors such as genre, user ratings, and popularity.

To use the site, users can create an account and customize their profile by selecting their preferred genres and rating movies they've already watched. The website then uses this information to generate personalized recommendations for the user.

The front-end of the website was built using React, providing a modern and responsive user interface. The back-end was built using Django, which enables fast and secure data management. I also used Python and JavaScript for various data processing and scripting tasks.

Overall, this project was an exciting opportunity for me to combine multiple technologies to create a useful and engaging product. I hope that you enjoy using my movie recommendation site and discover many new movies that you love!


DAY 1
    I made the project. The server is established and running

DAY 2
    I was working on the django model(database) for the movies. Debugging, site does not show input for the fields like age, genre etc.

DAY 3
    Finally found the bug(views.py, CreateAPIView, not ListAPIView) I added the Avatar movie to the database

DAY 4
    I intergrated React and Babel into the project to show the start of the apps frontend. I thought of the apps name, "SwipeFlix"
